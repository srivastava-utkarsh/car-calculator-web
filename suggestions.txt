Here are up-to-date, high-performing AdSense placements and sizes, including mobile. Use these as a testing baseline, then A/B with your audience and layout.

Best-performing ad sizes
- Desktop:
  - 300×250 (Medium rectangle) — versatile, strong demand.[1][2]
  - 336×280 (Large rectangle) — strong eCPMs, in-content/below articles.[2][1]
  - 728×90 (Leaderboard) — header/footer branding, high viewability when near fold.[1][2]
  - 300×600 (Half page) — very prominent, fast-growing impressions.[2][1]
  - 970×250 (Billboard/pushdown) — premium/sponsorship slots.[2]

- Mobile:
  - 320×100 (Large mobile banner) — top performer for mobile banners.[3][1][2]
  - 320×50 (Mobile leaderboard) — staple unit for top/bottom placements.[3][2]
  - 300×250 (MREC) — in-content; can be above the fold if content remains visible.[4][5]
  - 300×100 — alternative large mobile banner; often used in multi-size slots.[6]
  - Interstitials 320×480 — full-screen, use sparingly and policy-compliant.[7][6]

High-yield placement patterns
- Above-the-fold (ATF) but not intrusive:
  - Place a banner near the bottom of the first screen, just above the fold; this often maximizes viewability without pushing content down.[5]
  - Avoid large units that push main content below the fold on mobile; ensure content remains clearly visible.[8][4]

- In-content placements:
  - 300×250 or 336×280 embedded between paragraphs or after intro; repeat once mid-article and once near the end for long posts.[1][2]
  - On mobile, 300×250 within content performs very well; keep spacing so it’s clearly distinct from editorial content.[3][2]

- Sticky/anchor:
  - Mobile sticky 320×50 or 320×100 at bottom can perform strongly without blocking content; ensure close button and policy compliance.[9][3][2]

- Sidebars (desktop):
  - 300×600 sticky or 300×250 units in a sidebar that remains in view while scrolling improve viewability.[5][2]

- Footer/top:
  - 728×90 or 970×250 near the footer or just before comments/related posts for additional viewable impressions.[1][2]

Policy and UX tips to protect revenue
- Keep content visible on mobile; don’t let ads push primary content below the fold.[8]
- Place ATF units slightly below top navigation or just above the fold for best viewability.[5]
- Use responsive ad units and multi-size ad slots (e.g., 320×100 | 320×50; 336×280 | 300×250) to maximize fill [6][2].
- Optimize speed; slow ads reduce viewability as users scroll past before render.[5]
- Avoid deceptive placements; label ads clearly and keep spacing to prevent accidental clicks.[9][8]
