Got it — I see your current EMI pre-payment calculator design. Right now, it has a lot of good data but it feels heavy and segmented in a way that forces the user to jump between blocks. The main issues are:

* **Too many boxes with different backgrounds and colors** → visual overload.
* **Repetitive information** → tenure and EMI values appear multiple times.
* **Impact analysis buried** → the most important insight (“you save ₹X and finish Y months earlier”) should be the first thing they see.
* **Numbers not visually prioritized** → the key figures don't “pop” enough.

Here’s how I’d redesign it into a **clean, compact, and intuitive** layout:

---

## **Layout Strategy**

### 1️⃣ Hero Summary Card at the Top

* Show **before vs after** in a **side-by-side comparison** (split card or table) so users see changes instantly.
* Highlight **total savings** and **time saved** as the hero numbers in big bold fonts.

Example:

```
----------------------------------------------------
| Without Prepayment     | With Prepayment         |
----------------------------------------------------
| Tenure: 3 yrs          | 2 yrs 11 months         |
| Interest: ₹1,02,487    | ₹98,227                 |
----------------------------------------------------
  💰 You save ₹4,260 and finish 1 month earlier
```

* Use **green for savings** and **light gray for base values**.

---

### 2️⃣ Inputs in a Single Collapsible Panel

* All loan details and prepayment strategy inputs go in **one clean form panel** (accordion style), e.g.:

  * Loan amount
  * EMI (auto-calculated, read-only)
  * Interest rate
  * Tenure
  * Prepayment amount + frequency
  * Prepayment penalty
* Keep it compact with **two-column form fields**.

---

### 3️⃣ Visual Timeline for Tenure Change

* Add a small **horizontal progress bar** or timeline showing:

```
[████████████████████] 3 yrs (Before)
[██████████████████  ] 2 yrs 11 mo (After)
```

* This gives a quick, visual sense of how much earlier the loan finishes.

---

### 4️⃣ Simplified Impact Section

* Instead of repeating EMI and cost in multiple boxes, use **one clear table**:

```
Metric              Before        After         Savings
---------------------------------------------------------
Tenure              3 yrs         2 yrs 11 mo   1 month
Interest Paid       ₹1,02,487     ₹98,227       ₹4,260
Monthly EMI         ₹25,069       ₹25,069       -
```

* Savings column in green for instant recognition.

---

### 5️⃣ Minimal Color Palette

* **Primary**: White background with dark text for clarity.
* **Accent**: Single savings color (green or teal) for anything “good” and red only if it’s a loss or penalty.
* **Avoid multiple gradient backgrounds**; they make it feel cluttered.

---

### 6️⃣ Microcopy for Clarity

* Small notes under results like:

  > “Savings calculated after prepayment penalty”
  > “EMI remains unchanged; tenure reduces”
* Keep them subtle (lighter gray, small font).

---

### 7️⃣ Optional — Interactive Toggle

* Toggle button: **“Reduce EMI”** vs **“Reduce Tenure”**
* Changes instantly reflected in the “After” column.
