                    BUDGETGEAR LOAN PREPAYMENT CALCULATOR
                         COMPLETE FLOW SUMMARY & TEST RESULTS
================================================================================

üìã OVERVIEW
-----------
This document provides a comprehensive summary of the BudgetGear loan prepayment
calculator's complete flow, RBI compliance implementation, and detailed test 
results with actual values.

================================================================================
üíº CALCULATOR FLOW - STEP BY STEP
================================================================================

üîπ STEP 1: LOAN PARAMETER INPUT
-------------------------------
The calculator accepts loan parameters from the main car calculator:
‚Ä¢ Car Price: User input (e.g., ‚Çπ10,00,000)
‚Ä¢ Down Payment: User input (e.g., ‚Çπ2,00,000)
‚Ä¢ Interest Rate: User input (e.g., 8% per annum)
‚Ä¢ Loan Tenure: User input (e.g., 3 years)

Calculated Loan Amount = Car Price - Down Payment
Example: ‚Çπ10,00,000 - ‚Çπ2,00,000 = ‚Çπ8,00,000

üîπ STEP 2: ORIGINAL LOAN CALCULATION
------------------------------------
Using standard EMI formula:
EMI = [P √ó r √ó (1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
‚Ä¢ P = Principal (Loan Amount)
‚Ä¢ r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
‚Ä¢ n = Number of months (Years √ó 12)

Example Calculation:
‚Ä¢ Principal: ‚Çπ8,00,000
‚Ä¢ Monthly Rate: 8% √∑ 12 √∑ 100 = 0.006667
‚Ä¢ Months: 3 √ó 12 = 36

Original EMI = ‚Çπ25,069
Original Total = ‚Çπ25,069 √ó 36 = ‚Çπ9,02,487
Original Interest = ‚Çπ9,02,487 - ‚Çπ8,00,000 = ‚Çπ1,02,487

üîπ STEP 3: PREPAYMENT CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------------
User configures prepayment strategy:
‚Ä¢ Strategy Selection: "Reduce Tenure" OR "Reduce EMI"
‚Ä¢ Prepayment Amount: User input (e.g., ‚Çπ16,000)
‚Ä¢ Frequency: "Monthly" OR "Yearly"

For optimal savings, "Reduce Tenure" is recommended.

üîπ STEP 4: RBI-COMPLIANT CALCULATION ENGINE
-------------------------------------------
The calculator implements RBI guidelines:

‚úÖ Prepayment Timing: Applied AFTER scheduled EMI payment
‚úÖ Yearly Frequency: Applied at exact 12-month intervals (months 12, 24, 36...)
‚úÖ Principal Reduction: Immediate deduction from outstanding balance
‚úÖ Interest Recalculation: Next EMI uses reduced balance

Monthly Processing Loop:
1. Calculate interest on remaining principal
2. Apply regular EMI (interest + principal)
3. Reduce outstanding balance by principal portion
4. IF prepayment month: Apply prepayment to reduce balance further
5. Continue until loan is fully paid or tenure ends
