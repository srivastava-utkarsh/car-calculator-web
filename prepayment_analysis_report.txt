# 1. EMI CALCULATION

## Google Sheets / Excel:
=-PMT(AnnualRate/12, TenureMonths, Principal)

## JavaScript:
function PMT(rate, nper, pv) {
  if (rate === 0) return pv / nper;
  return (pv * rate * Math.pow(1 + rate, nper)) / (Math.pow(1 + rate, nper) - 1);
}
// Usage:
const monthlyRate = annualRate / 12 / 100;
const emi = PMT(monthlyRate, totalMonths, principal);


# 2. AMORTIZATION PER MONTH

## Google Sheets:
[InterestPayment]  = [OutstandingBalancePrev] * (AnnualRate/12)
[PrincipalPayment] = [EMI] - [InterestPayment]
[OutstandingBalanceNew] = [OutstandingBalancePrev] - [PrincipalPayment]

## JavaScript:
let interestPayment = balance * monthlyRate;
let principalPayment = emi - interestPayment;
balance = balance - principalPayment;


# 3. PREPAYMENT APPLICATION

## Google Sheets (PREPAY BEFORE EMI - common method):
If MOD(MonthRow, PrepayFreq) = 0 Then
  [OutstandingBalance] = [OutstandingBalance] - PrepaymentAmount
End If

## JavaScript:
if ((month % prepayFreq) === 0 && balance > 0) {
  let actualPrepay = Math.min(prepay, balance);
  balance -= actualPrepay;
}


# 4. FULL AMORTIZATION LOOP (JS STYLE)

let month = 0, totalInterest = 0, totalPaid = 0;
while(balance > 1 && month  0) {
    let actualPrepay = Math.min(prepay, balance);
    balance -= actualPrepay;
  }
  let interest = balance * monthlyRate;
  let principalPart = Math.min(emi - interest, balance);
  balance -= principalPart;
  totalInterest += interest;
  totalPaid += principalPart + interest;
  // (Optionally apply prepayment here if prepay-after-EMI style)
}

# 5. SUMMARY CALCULATIONS

## Google Sheets
Total Amount Paid:      =SUM(EMI_Col) + SUM(Prepayment_Col)
Total Interest Paid:    =SUM(Interest_Col)
Amount Saved:           =TotalInterest_NoPrepay - TotalInterest_WithPrepay

## JavaScript:
const amountSaved = origInterest - totalInterest;  // origInterest is calculated from normal EMI schedule

================================================================================

# Notes:
- All formulas use absolute values for money (outflows as positive).
- For “Reduce Tenure” strategy, run loop until balance  1 && m <= tenureMonths + 60; ++m) {
    // Optionally apply prepayment?
    // ... see above ...
    let interest = balance * monthlyRate;
    let principalPaid = Math.min(emi - interest, balance);
    // Store month, interest, principal, balance, prepay etc.
    results.push({month: m, interest, principalPaid, emi, prepay: 0, opening: balance});
    balance -= principalPaid;
  }
  return results;
}

Here’s a focused analysis and up-to-date banking industry audit (2025) based on the attached report, your previous logic, and current practices at top Indian banks/NBFCs:

***

## 1. **High Impact: PREPAYMENT APPLICATION TIMING**

**What does the report say?**
- **Current code:** Prepayment is applied AFTER EMI. Interest that month is charged on the larger balance.
- **Suggestion/Sheets style:** Prepayment applied BEFORE EMI. Interest that month is charged after principal is reduced—this yields *higher* interest savings for the borrower.

**What do Indian banks/NBFCs do?**  
- **BEST PRACTICE & INDUSTRY STANDARD:**  
  - **Prepayment is ALWAYS applied before the next interest calculation for the new period**—that is, as soon as the extra money is received, principal is reduced immediately, and the next EMI’s interest is calculated on the lower balance.[1][2][3][4][5]
  - **RBI**: Has not mandated "pre-EMI" vs "post-EMI," but all major bank/NBFC calculators (HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Bajaj, BoB, etc.) and their support docs show interest saving calculated by applying prepayment *immediately* before the next interest accrual.  
  - **Practical explanation:** If you deposit a lump sum on Jan 14, interest from the next EMI cycle (Feb 1) is calculated on your reduced balance.
  - As a result, **prepay-before-EMI is the most accurate and most customer-friendly approach**—and how almost all reputable banks’ calculators simulate it today.

**Action:**  
- **Move your prepayment logic to "before EMI/interest accrual"** in the amortization loop for both “reduce tenure” and “reduce EMI” modes.
- This matches well-tested industry practice and regulatory expectation for *how savings are presented*.

***

## 2. **Medium Impact: PREPAYMENT FREQUENCY LOGIC**

**What does the report say?**
- Code currently applies monthly prepayment by default, only yearly via a separate flag, and the check isn’t modular.
- Inaccuracy can creep in if logic doesn’t fully respect the user-input frequency (e.g., every X months, arbitrary months).

**What do Indian banks/NBFCs do?**
- **HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, Bajaj, Bank of Baroda, and others:**  
  - Allow prepayment at intervals as allowed in the agreement: monthly, quarterly, yearly, or custom scheduled (bonus months, festival, etc.).[3][6][1]
  - Frequency check is straightforward: **if (currentMonth % prepayFrequency === 0)**, then apply prepayment. Advanced calculators let the user input an array of months for ad hoc prepayments.
  - Banks may put operational limits (minimum ₹25,000, or once per quarter in some fixed loans), but mathematically, **the frequency is applied using modulo checks for regular intervals**.

**Action:**
- **Standardize your prepayment logic** to:  
  ```js
  if ((month % prepayFrequency) === 0 && balance > 0) {
      let actualPrepay = Math.min(prepay, balance);
      balance -= actualPrepay;
  }
  ```
- Optionally, provide custom scheduling for advanced users.

***

## 3. **Current Best Practices: Top Banks & NBFCs**

- **All leading Indian banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, BoB) and NBFCs (Bajaj, L&T, PNBHF, LICHFL, Tata Cap, etc.) now:**
  - Prepayment, when made, is applied *immediately to principal*, and the next EMI's interest is calculated on the lower outstanding.[4][5][6][7][1][3]
  - Part-prepayment can be made at any permitted frequency—more flexible for floating rate and for fixed rate after a lock-in.[6][8]
  - Schedule is recalculated accordingly, and customer is shown actual interest/time saved.
  - Most customer-facing calculators show a **month-by-month table with the prepayment deducted prior to interest for that period**.

***

## 4. **Summary Table**

| Aspect                         | Current Code | Best Practice / Top Banks       | Recommendation                           |
|---------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Prepayment Timing               | After EMI    | *Before* EMI/interest accrual   | **Switch to before EMI calculation**     |
| Prepayment Frequency Logic      | Hardcoded/Flag| Modulo (month % freq == 0)     | **Standardize on modulo/flexible input** |
| Amortization Table Display      | After-deduction | Pre-deduction/pre-EMI         | **Show after prepay, interest recalced** |

***

## 5. **Recommended Solutions**
1. **SIGNIFICANT:**
   - Apply prepayment BEFORE that month's EMI/interest calculation.
   - This will increase calculated borrower savings and match reality/customer expectation and all major Indian online calculators.
2. **MODULAR:**
   - Use a frequency check like `if (month % prepayFrequency === 0)` for all prepayment scheduling.

### **Citations and Real-World Examples**
- RBI Prepayment Charges Directions 2025[9][10][11][12][13]
- HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis, Bank of Baroda online and offline calculators[5][7][8][14][1][6]
- Bajaj, PNB, L&T, Tata, LIC, Ujjivan customer guides and T&Cs[8][6]

***

**Bottom line:**  
**Applying prepayment before EMI calculation is the gold standard for accuracy and customer transparency. All major Indian financial institutions apply and display it in this manner for interest savings/max benefit calculators.**  
Switching your code's logic per above will bring your tool in line with India’s top-performing banks, NBFCs, and RBI-aligned consumer fairness.
